# Overview

ersp is an abbreviation for explore, reflect, summarize, practice.
The project hopes to establish a personal thought system, distill fragmentary knowledge and experience into systematic thoughts, so as to guide future behavior in reality and efficiently handle all incidents encountered

## Specification

I tried to do similar things before, but failed for many reasons. It would be very appropriate to do this with the help of git. One reason is that there is no strict specification for the format of the content, which leads to the content being mixed into an article, which is a bit confusing. Therefore, here are some principled rules:

- Conciseness: Don't write it as a diary, don't analyze a little thing
- Clear: reasonable classification
- Abstraction: Extract from events
- Rich: Including low-level thinking and upper-level applications
- Useful: not divorced from practice
- Agile: Ability to think quickly and apply

In addition, different format requirements need to be proposed based on different content.

## Content Classification

Content classification is a very important work, which directly determines the life of the project. The following points need to be considered:

- Easy to use: When an incident occurs, you can quickly add and modify the content involved
- Comprehensive: Need to pay attention to all aspects of human behavior
- Clear boundaries: high cohesion, low coupling
- Clear structure: the location of each floor appears reasonable

## Terms of Use

The use specification is mainly considered from the perspective of economy

- Emphasis: Only record those that are worth recording, good or bad, and not engage in running accounts in life
